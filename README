table -- turn tab-delemited input into tables

Better than `column -t` because it's aware of ANSI escape sequences,
and so doesn't choke on colors.

DEPENDENCIES

A working Ruby interpreter is required.

INSTALLATION

Recommended installation is through Homebrew:

    brew install alyssais/formulae/table

Or, obtain the source code and run the following from the project root:

    rake install

USAGE

    echo ... | table
    table tabfile.tsv
